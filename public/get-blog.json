Each new case required 3-4 hours of administrative work before attorneys could even begin substantive legal work.We implemented a custom AI solution that automated document classification, extracted key information from legal documents using OCR and NLP, and streamlined their client intake process with an intelligent form system.Results after 3 months: 40 hours per week saved, 95% accuracy in document classification, and client onboarding time reduced from 4 hours to 20 minutes. The ROI was achieved in just 6 weeks.The system now processes contracts, identifies key clauses, flags potential issues, and prepares preliminary summaries for attorney review.",

			"content": "One of the most common questions we hear is: 'Should we build a custom AI model or use an existing solution?' The answer depends on several factors including your use case, data availability, budget, and timeline.Off-the-shelf AI solutions are perfect for common use cases like chatbots, sentiment analysis, or basic document processing. They're faster to deploy, more cost-effective initially, and require less technical expertise to maintain.Custom AI models make sense when you have unique requirements, proprietary data that provides competitive advantage, specific performance needs, or when you're processing sensitive data that can't leave your infrastructure.We've worked with companies at both ends of the spectrum. A retail client saved $200K by using existing computer vision APIs, while a healthcare client needed a custom HIPAA-compliant model for specialized medical imaging analysis.This article breaks down the decision framework we use with clients to determine the best approach.",
