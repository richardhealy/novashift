			},
			"solution": {
				"title": "Our Solution",
				"text": "We led a structured discovery process to shape the product, define the technical architecture, and plan a phased development roadmap. Through a collaborative workshop, we clarified the vision and user needs. We then designed a modular system architecture tailored to the AI engine, outlined buildable features, and mapped the path to an MVP. A detailed specification document captured system components, workflows, data flow, and user experience flows. We also assessed key risks and proposed mitigation strategies to reduce uncertainty and control future development costs."

The system needed to be secure, scalable, and reliable enough to support multiple concurrent projects without disruption."
			},
			"solution": {
				"title": "Our Solution",
				"text": "We built a full AI-powered development automation platform integrating Claude AI, Asana, and GitHub. The system featured a central orchestrator that managed workflow logic and multiple specialized services for project management, repository handling, and code generation. Each task ran in isolated AI-managed workspaces to ensure security and stability. Deployed with Docker and fortified with webhook verification and non-root execution, the platform delivered seamless automation—from task creation to pull request submission—with real-time feedback and error handling."
			},
			"results": {
				"title": "Results",
				"text": "The client received a production-ready system that streamlined every step of their development workflow.

They needed a fully automated system that could generate, test, and deploy videos efficiently while staying adaptable to new AI tools and workflows."
			},
			"solution": {
				"title": "Our Solution",

The solution integrated advanced AI tools such as Runway ML, ShotStack, Stability AI, and ElevenLabs, supported by centralized data management in Airtable. Intelligent automation flows with human verification points ensured quality control, while a dynamic A/B testing framework enabled rapid iteration. Built in agile sprints, the system evolved from MVP to a robust, production-ready automation platform."

The goal was simple but technically demanding—upload a website or Instagram profile and let AI produce stunning, on-brand content ready for publication. Delivering that required advanced integrations across AI content generation, social APIs, and payment systems—all in a user-friendly, scalable environment."
			},
			"solution": {
				"title": "Our Solution",
				"text": "We developed a comprehensive full-stack social automation platform combining modern web technologies and AI. The frontend, built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, delivered a polished and responsive experience. The backend integrated Supabase, Stripe, and Meta's Graph API for secure authentication, subscription handling, and automated posting. Using AI models for content generation, brand voice detection, and scheduling, users could generate and preview content, then publish it directly—turning a once-manual process into a seamless, intelligent workflow."
